# Text-Generation-using-RNN

After successfully addressing this classic Text Generation problem using excerpts from the famous Game of Thrones book, I've achieved significant progress in open-ended language models. Utilizing distinct deep learning architectures, I generated coherent and contextually relevant text based on the provided initial chapters. This advancement in AI fictional corpus generation opens new possibilities for more sophisticated and creative language generation models.
